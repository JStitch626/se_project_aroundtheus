# Project 4: Around The U.S. interactive

## Description

Updated 11/24/2023

This project continues where Project 3 finished. In this sprint, I incorporate the interactive features using JavaScript. The end user can manipulate the name and description on the page by clicking the "Edit" button beside the name and changing the information.

When the modal opens, the form contains the current information on the page, which can then be changed. When the end user clicks the "Save" button, the new information replaces the name and description.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- BEM blocks
- Grid
- CSS media queries
- Figma layout
- JavaScript
- Updating the README.md file
- Using git branch
- Deploying the project to Github Pages

### Project 3: Around The U.S.

This project exhibits a webpage with an adaptive design. Incorporating lessons from the previous two sprints and introducing Figma as an additional tool, I built a website that adapts to different screen sizes:

- 1280px desktop
- 800px tablet
- 320px mobile phone

Unlike the previous sprints that were divided into stages with briefs, we received only a general overview and the Figma design and had to create everything from scratch.

### Code corrections

- card.css - line 42 change opacity from 0.6 to 0.5 according to Figma design
- page.css - line 36 remove redundant css rule
- profile.css - assign border styles of '1px solid' to `profile__edit-button` selector as shown in Figma design
- index.html - line 23-24 remove extraneous containers
- button style - add `cursor: pointer` declaration to each button so that a hand appears over the hovered button
- index.html - line 41 `.cards__list` must be listed by itself because BEM does not allow `class="block block__element"`

### Code enhancements

- accessibility - add `aria-label` attribute to buttons, making interactive elements more accessible for end users who use screen readers

### Future goals

- Learn how to use auto-fit to make a more responsive layout.

#### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
