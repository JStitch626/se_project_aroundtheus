# Project 6: Around The U.S.

## Description

**_Objects, Event Handling, and Form Validation in JavaScript_**

Updated 9/15/2024

This project introduces form validation by implementing error messages and disabling the "Save" button when inputs are invalid.

### Project 5 Becomes More Engaging

_JavaScript Program Logic and Methods_

Updated 1/15/2024

In the previous sprint, we successfully implemented the initial interactive feature of the webpage, enabling users to open, edit, and close their profile. In this sprint, we will extend functionality by adding JavaScript to allow users to add or delete cards and use the "Like" button to mark their favorite cards. Additionally, popup modals will now feature smooth transitions to and from transparency for enhanced visual appeal.

### Project 4: Around The U.S. interactive

_Basic JavaScript and Working with the DOM_

Updated 11/24/2023

This project builds upon the work completed in Project 3. In this sprint, we have integrated interactive features using JavaScript. We have learned to access DOM nodes with querySelector() and querySelectorAll(), define variables, and create and invoke functions to enhance button functionality.

The "Edit" button now allows users to modify the name and description on the page. Upon clicking the button, a modal appears containing the current information, which can be updated. Clicking the "Save" button then replaces the old information with the newly entered details.

### Code Enhancements

- created separate functions for `openProfileModal` and `setProfileData` and called the functions in the `addEventListener`

### Project 3: Around The U.S.

_Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts_

This project exhibits a webpage with an adaptive design. Incorporating lessons from the previous two sprints and introducing Figma as an additional tool, we built a website that adapts to different screen sizes:

- 1280px desktop
- 800px tablet
- 320px mobile phone

Unlike the previous sprints which were divided into stages with briefs, we received only a general overview and the Figma design and had to create everything from scratch.

### Code enhancements

- accessibility - add `aria-label` attribute to buttons, making interactive elements more accessible for end users who use screen readers

### Future goals

- Learn how to use auto-fit to make a more responsive layout.

### Original README.md from TripleTen

_Below you will find the overview provided by TripleTen, including a link to the Figma design and a resource to optimize image sizes for faster loading times._

#### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
