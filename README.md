# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Description

This project exhibits a webpage with an adaptive design. Incorporating lessons from the previous two sprints and introducing Figma as an additional tool, I built a website that adapts to different screen sizes:

- 1280px desktop
- 800px tablet
- 320px mobile phone

Unlike the previous sprints that were divided into stages with briefs, we received only a general overview and the Figma design and had to create everything from scratch.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- BEM blocks
- Grid
- CSS media queries
- Figma layout
- Composing a README.md file
- Deploying the project to Github Pages

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
